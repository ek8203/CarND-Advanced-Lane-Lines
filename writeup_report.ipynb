    "* Compute the camera calibration matrix and distortion coefficients given a set of chessboard images.\n",

    "\n",
    "The code for this step is contained in the code cell `[2]` of the IPython notebook [advanced_lane_finding.ipynb](advanced_lane_finding.ipynb). The code calculates the camera matrix and distortion coefficients using the images in the `camera_cal/` folder. It was adopted from original Udacity [source](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Camera-Calibration).\n",
    "\n",
    "I start by preparing \"object points\", which will be the (x, y, z) coordinates of the chessboard corners in the world. Here I am assuming the chessboard is fixed on the (x, y) plane at z=0, such that the object points are the same for each calibration image. Thus, `objp` is just a replicated array of coordinates, and `objpoints` will be appended with a copy of it every time I successfully detect all chessboard corners in a test image. `imgpoints` will be appended with the (x, y) pixel position of each of the corners in the image plane with each successful chessboard detection. I used OpenCV library to extract object points `objpoints` and image points `imgpoints` needed for camera calibration. I saved the camera calibration matrix and distortion coefficients in file `camera_cal/dist_pickle.p` and in the instance of the 'Line()' class.\n",

First I calculated the radius of curvature in the pixel space and then scaled the measurements to the warld space (meters) with the following scale parameters: `30 meters per 720 pixels in y dimension` and `3.7 meters per 700 pixels in x dimension`\n",

Then I took a mean value of the base points of the detected lines at the bottom of the image as a center of the lane.

    "The techniques in the project are taken directly from the class lessons. It covers just the basics and it was not tested in low light conditions or on a road with only one left line ceparating the traffic direction. Also it was not tested on the traffic lanes separated by double lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "I believe there is plenty of room for improvement if I was going to pursue this project further. First I would spend more time on creating tresholded binary images by using more challenging images with not clear lane lines. Second I would use better filters to smooth the video with detected lines. And finaly I would change the structure of the project by creating separate python modules responsible for different image processing steps and importing the modules to the IPython notebook. Also my Line() class is missing a proper constructor, sanity check and access methods.   "
